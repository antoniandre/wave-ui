 | An emerging new UI framework for Vue.js with only the bright side.\n    span.xl.ml2 ☀️\n\n  .title3.mt6 Like other UI frameworks, Wave UI is:\n  w-list(:items=\"features1\" icon=\"wi-check\")\n\n  .title3.mt6 But it is also:\n  w-list(:items=\"features2\" icon=\"wi-check\")\n\n  title-link(h2) Wave UI is developed with a particular care about CSS.\n  p.title3.\n    Practically Wave UI gives you more flexibility and more control over the CSS.\n  blockquote.mt2.\n    Because inline styles and #[code !important] are a nightmare to override,\n    Wave UI has chosen to use not-too-specific selectors and promote the CSS styling\n    rather than Javascript dynamic styling.\n\n  p.mt3.\n    In Wave UI framework, all the styles are scoped to the framework UI elements:\n    you will not see any style applied to DOM elements.#[br]\n    This way, you stay the master of your global styles.\n\n  p.mt3.\n    We also encourage you to use Wave UI CSS classes when you can, and sometimes choose to\n    override styles via CSS rather than appending dynamic styles via Javascript.\n\n  p And to keep your CSS easy to override, always avoid the #[code !important] keyword.\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data: () => ({\n    features1: [\n      { label: 'fully responsive' },\n      { label: 'accessibility compliant' },\n      { label: 'very
