icon=\"wi-check\")\n\n  title-link(h2) CSS-wise...\n  .title3 Wave UI is developed with a particular care about CSS.\n  p.title3.\n    Practically Wave UI gives you more flexibility and more control over the CSS.\n  alert.my5(tip).\n    Because inline styles and #[code !important] are a nightmare to override,\n    Wave UI has chosen to use not-too-specific selectors and promote the CSS styling\n    rather than Javascript dynamic styling.\n\n  .title3.mt6.\n    In the Wave UI framework, all the styles are scoped to the framework UI elements\n  p.\n    You will not see any style applied to DOM elements.#[br]\n    This way, you stay the master of your global styles.\n\n  p.\n    Which means that if you decide to style a button from scratch from this #[button default button],\n    to this #[w-button.mx1 great button], Wave UI will not be on your way with tons of default styles.#[br]\n    If you don't use a Wave UI element at some point, it's your choice and we respect that!\n\n  .title3.mt6.\n    We also encourage you\n  p.\n    to use Wave UI CSS classes when you can, and sometimes choose to\n    override styles via CSS rather than appending dynamic styles via Javascript.\n\n  p And to keep your CSS easy to override, always avoid the #[code !important] keyword.\n\n  .w-divider.my12\n\n  title-link(h2) What it doesn't do\n  .title4.my4.\n    Wave UI's philosophy is to focus on more CSS flexibility to allow more complex designs and an overall\n    easy and pleasant CSS experience.\n\n  p.\n    In consequence, you may not find all the (edge case) options on a UI component to make you 100% happy\n    out of the box, without adding a line of CSS.#[br]#[br]\n\n    That's a trade-off: the more options a component has, the more it becomes complex, heavy, and harder to\n    override via CSS.#[br]#[br]\n\n    #[strong Let's face it: a great UI, especially the one you are creating, is built with CSS! ;)]\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default
